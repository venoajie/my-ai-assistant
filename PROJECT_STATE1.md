# Project State: RAG Indexing Architecture Implementation

- **version**: 1.0
- **status**: PENDING_ARCHITECTURAL_IMPLEMENTATION
- **goal**: "Implement the full RAG indexing architecture using GitHub Actions and Oracle Cloud Object Storage as previously decided."

## Project Plan & Dependency Chain

1.  **Phase: Architectural Implementation**
    -   **Specialist:** `domains/programming/csa-1`
    -   **Input:** The final architectural decision (v4.0), `PROJECT_BLUEPRINT.md`, and relevant source code (`rag_plugin.py`, `indexer.py`, `config.py`).
    -   **Output:** A new `.github/workflows/smart-indexing.yml` file and modified versions of the client-side Python files.
    -   **Status:** PENDING

2.  **Phase: Documentation**
    -   **Specialist:** `domains/programming/dca-1` (Documentation & Content Architect)
    -   **Input:** The implemented code and workflow file from Phase 1.
    -   **Output:** New documentation files (`docs/rag_deployment.md`, `docs/rollback_plan.md`).
    -   **Status:** BLOCKED (depends on Phase 1)

## Current Task Brief
- **Task ID:** 1
- **Assigned To:** `domains/programming/csa-1`
- **Objective:** Implement the complete, production-grade RAG architecture. This includes creating the GitHub Actions workflow for delta indexing and uploading to OCI, and refactoring the client-side Python code to include smart caching, branch-aware state management, and a resilient fallback chain. The implementation must adhere to the finalized architectural decision (v4.0).
