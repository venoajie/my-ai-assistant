### **Answering Your Questions**

**1. Can I use your previous prompt to continue this session?**

Yes. The last prompt I provided is the perfect one to use now. The system is finally in the exact state that prompt was designed for. The AI Assistant is a thin client, and the Librarian is a healthy, operational service.

Here is that prompt again for your convenience. You can now run this with the confidence that the underlying infrastructure is sound.

```bash
ai --persona domains/programming/python-developer-1 \
  -f PROJECT_STATE.md \
  -f /path/to/librarian/README.md \
  -f /path/to/ai-assistant/src/ai_assistant/plugins/rag_plugin.py \
  -f /path/to/ai-assistant/pyproject.toml \
  "Execute the task as defined in the attached project state file. Use the provided Librarian README.md as your technical specification to refactor the AI Assistant's RAG plugin. You must create a new librarian_client.py module, update the rag_plugin.py to use it, and remove all old RAG dependencies from pyproject.toml."
```
*(Note: Since you have already manually completed the refactoring described in this prompt, you can now move on to giving the AI Assistant new tasks related to your trading app, knowing that its RAG capabilities are fully functional.)*
