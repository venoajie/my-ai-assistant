# Version: 1.4
# Description: This file is the canonical, machine-readable data dictionary for the AI Assistant.
# It defines the schema and purpose of all major internal data contracts and transient process artifacts.

# SECTION 1: PERSISTENT DATA CONTRACTS
# These contracts define the structure of data that is fundamental to the
# long-term operation and state of the application. They represent the core,
# persistent data models of the system.

# SECTION 2: TRANSIENT PROCESS ARTIFACTS
